information and trading products. These include market data, such as share prices and currency rates, research and analytics, as well as trading systems that
allow dealers to buy and sell such things as currencies and shares on a computer screen instead of by telephone or on a trading floor like that of the New York

The offer - the latest among proposals put forth in recent months to resuscitate the once high-flying Internet company - is expected to be considered by Yahoo's board on Thursday, sources said.
The board was uninterested in entertaining offers for the entire company at this point, said one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Yahoo's increasing difficulty in competing with Internet heavyweights such as Google Inc and Facebook have forced it to explore proposals to revamp its business.
The former Internet powerhouse, which fired its Chief Executive Carol Bartz in September, has a market value of around $18.5 billion.
The Asian split-off plan to be considered by the board follows previous proposals by private equity firms to buy a minority stake in Yahoo. Those proposals were fiercely opposed by some of Yahoo's largest shareholders, including activist hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, of Third Point LLC.
&quot;It's clear that Dan Loeb at Third Point is exerting some influence,&quot; said Adam Seessel, director of research at Martin Capital Management, which added to its position in Yahoo a few weeks ago. He &quot;is doing all Yahoo shareholders a favor by looking over the board and making sure they do the right thing.&quot;
Yahoo shares, which languished in the red along with much of the technology sector on Wednesday, reversed course and ended the session almost 6 percent higher at $15.99. It inched further upward in after-hours trading to $16.09.
At a $17 billion valuation, which includes the value of the Alibaba stake that Yahoo would retain under the latest proposal, a deal would mean the Asian assets are worth $14 per Yahoo share, one of the sources said.
The deal would essentially mean that Yahoo's core U.S.-based Internet business is valued at only $2 a share, according to Lawrence Haverty, a fund manager with GAMCO investors, which owns Yahoo shares.
Given that Yahoo has roughly $2 a share in cash on its balance sheet, Haverty said the deal left plenty of room for upside in the core business.
&quot;This is the right thing to do. This is how you maximize shareholder value,&quot; he said, noting that he believed the tax-free structure of the plan seemed feasible.
TAX-FREE DEAL
Alibaba chief Jack Ma has said several times he would like to buy back Yahoo's stake in his company, one of Asia's largest Internet corporations. Investors have long said Yahoo's investment in Alibaba, along with its 35 percent slice of Yahoo Japan, are far and away the U.S. company's most prized assets.
In the deal under contemplation, Yahoo would effectively transfer most of its 40 percent slice of Alibaba back to the Chinese company and all of its stake in Yahoo Japan to Softbank Corp, sources said.
Alibaba and Yahoo Japan would each create separate legal entities where they would put cash and operating assets, and then trade those with Yahoo, making the deal tax-free, the sources said.
At the end of the contemplated transaction Yahoo would retain a 15 percent stake in Alibaba, the sources said.
The final deal size will depend on how the assets are valued, another source said.
&quot;It's definitely a step in the right direction. It shows that the board is thinking about shareholders as opposed to their own interests,&quot; Martin Capital's Seessel said.
Yahoo declined to comment. The possible deals were first reported in The New York Times.
Last week, sources told Reuters a consortium consisting of private equity group Silver Lake, Microsoft Corp and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz were reworking a bid for a minority stake in Yahoo.

&lt;p&gt;The decline in inventories was driven by a drop in imports. Meanwhile, gasoline supplies fell by 400K barrels, and distillates were down by 2.4 million barrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to this, Google's latest public data on Android activations was 550,000 devices per day as revealed by  Eric Schmidt  at LeWeb last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't help but feel that growth like that will soon mean more Android devices than  iOS  devices in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

You just press the large record button, which falls conveniently under your thumb when the camera is held upright like a mobile phone, and you're off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although images can't be uploaded while you're out and about, the Share button tags images (via email, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Kodak Gallery and so on) so when the camera is next connected to the computer they are shared. The options are inputted via the computer when the camera is first set up, so it's all very straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera comes with an in-built USB cable concealed within a secret section and the computer software is stored on the camera, so it all installs automatically when connected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its price and waterproof credentials (down to 3m) mean the Playfull is designed for shooting video and stills where you wouldn't want to take a serious camera, but at 1MP the images are only suitable for viewing on the computer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1280x720 pixel video footage is only reasonable for a camera of this type and price, but the sound quality is impressive. With no flash, this isn't the camera to take on nights out and to parties. But images taken in good light are acceptable, with decent colour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, light smudging of complex patterns and details is noticeable even at normal viewing sizes, and we recommend leaving the digital zoom control alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Review: Kodak Playfull ZE2</title><topic_set><topic>Facebook</topic></topic_set><created_at>2011-12-26 10:34:16</created_at><author_set><author>Nicholson, Angela</author></author_set><source><website>http://www.techradar.com</website><name>Tech Radar</name><circulation>245973</circulation><country>UK</country><frequency>Daily</frequency><media_type>Blog</media_type><guid>dcbe9892def8f77d555900b3588cf698</guid><is_blog>1</is_blog><thumbnail>http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.techradar.com</thumbnail><description>Tech Radar</description></source><published_at>2011-12-26 09:30:00</published_at><score>1.0166897</score><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/android-blog/~3/H3MS5JNju5g/story01.htm</link><guid>6dc9cc3726252ed78bdf1145c3dfe6f1</guid></article></article_set></cluster><cluster><article_set><article><category><dashed_name>technology</dashed_name><name>Technology</name></category><has_images>False</has_images><description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share  My Playlists, an excellent service that lets you upload and  discover new Spotify playlists , just released a list of the most popular tracks of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

					    Just kidding, of course you will, because it's Rebecca Black, and Rebecca Black is 2011's most important entity across culture, politics, and the whole of the space-time continuum. But what else mattered in our cosmos, YouTube-wise? Let's explore! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following  Facebook  and  Google's  trend of highlighting a whole bunch of inane horse shit with the occasional historical event sprinkled in, YouTube's most popular videos don't quite reflect the whole  social media changing the world  notion—although we did turn to the 'Tube for videos of change in Egypt, war in Libya, and disaster in Japan that couldn't be found elsewhere. Just not in numbers that can compete with Ms. Black—who in all honesty, is pretty stellar in her own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the top 10? A talking dog, a Jack Sparrow parody song, two babies talking to each other, Nyan Cat, Karmin's ear-ending, life transforming Chris Brown cover, an SNL skit, a little girl on the piano, a VW commercial, and some cats.  Phew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Lopez claimed the most popular music video of the year, perhaps offering proof that Rebecca Black's existence truly has opened up some sort of wormhole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what were we searching for? The top ten includes Ted Williams, that homeless guy with a nice voice who later turned out to be a criminal or something, Born This Way, Tsunami, Bin Laden, Drake, and Skyrim. You know, the stuff that will be in history books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it—the most popular moving image of the year was so because it was the year's most  reviled . A new renaissance is upon us. [ YouTube ]&lt;/p&gt;
