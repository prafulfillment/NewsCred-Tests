&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (fxtechstrategy.com) -- The GPB-USD pair is taking back some of its two-day gains following a lower weekly close last week. This development has opened the door for more declines toward the 1.5424 to 1.5410 levels. A violation of that level will target the October low of 1.5270. Further weakness will point toward its big psychological level at 1.5000. Its daily and weekly RSI are bearish and pointing lower suggesting further weakness.

It was founded by Allen 'Al' Neuharth. The paper has the widest circulation of any
newspaper in the United States (averaging over 2.25 million copies every weekday),
and among English-language broadsheets, it comes second world-wide. USA Today is
distributed in all 50 states. USA Today was founded in 1982 with the goal of providing
a national newspaper in the U.S. market, where generally only a single local newspaper
was available. Colorful and bold, with many large diagrams, charts, and photographs,
it contrasted with the relatively colorless papers of the time such as The Wall Street
Journal and The New York Times. Emphasizing its national focus, USA Today became
well-known for its national polls on public sentiment.</description></source><published_at>2011-12-13 14:56:18</published_at><score>1.0167041</score><link>http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/usatoday-TechTopStories/~3/55VI9uoT4Ss/1</link><guid>92b7f3ab00b7a28315bde05c68a9d69a</guid></article></article_set></cluster><cluster><article_set><article><category><dashed_name>technology</dashed_name><name>Technology</name></category><has_images>False</has_images><description>Facebook Inc., preparing for a potential initial public offering, plans to hire thousands of employees in the next year and add an engineering office in New York to lure technical talent.</description><title>Facebook to Hire Thousands of Workers, Open New York Office</title><topic_set><topic>Facebook</topic></topic_set><created_at>2011-12-02 23:33:53</created_at><source><website>http://www.businessweek.com/technology/index.html</website><name>BusinessWeek.com -- Technology</name><circulation>5092423</circulation><country>US</country><frequency>Daily</frequency><media_type>Blog</media_type><guid>e44ed8849c88f00a986354f2e3a710af</guid><is_blog>1</is_blog><thumbnail>http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.businessweek.com/technology/index.html</thumbnail><description>BusinessWeek.com -- Technology</description></source><published_at>2011-12-02 22:47:01</published_at><score>1.0158876</score><link>http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-02/facebook-to-hire-thousands-of-workers-open-new-york-office.html</link><guid>baa70b371e80f28ca16932b0cf5188a3</guid></article></article_set></cluster><cluster><article_set><article><category><dashed_name>business</dashed_name><name>Business</name></category><has_images>False</has_images><description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not going to be a Happy New Year at Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts have been unanimous in forecasting continuing euro weakness, however the currency had been trading near $1.34 just 10 days ago and near $1.50 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

Baldwin has been disparaging the bankrupt carrier via his Twitter account, but American said on its Facebook page that &quot;since an extremely vocal customer has publicly identified himself as being removed from an American Airlines  flight, we have elected to provide the actual facts of the matter.&quot; While Baldwin claims he was just playing game, the airline noted that when told to turn off the device, he retreated to the lavatory -- while the seat-belt sign was on -- and slammed the door loudly enough to alarm the crew. In addition, American said that Baldwin had been &quot;extremely rude&quot; to the crew and &quot;used offensive language&quot; prior to being removed from the flight.

paying a fee to use AP material without being contributive members of the cooperative. As of 2005, the AP's news is published and republished by more than 1,700 newspapers,

information and trading products. These include market data, such as share prices and currency rates, research and analytics, as well as trading systems that
allow dealers to buy and sell such things as currencies and shares on a computer screen instead of by telephone or on a trading floor like that of the New York
Stock Exchange. Among other services, the most notable is analysis of 40,000 companies, debt instruments, and 3 million economic series. Competitors include
Bloomberg L.P. and Dow Jones Newswires.</description></source><published_at>2011-12-13 23:02:54</published_at><score>1.0167497</score><link>http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/technologyNews/~3/KaqtmJzyz-Q/us-jive-ipo-idUSTRE7BC1EU20111213</link><guid>4549ab6883dd929a0c9f860a122217f0</guid></article></article_set></cluster><cluster><article_set><article><category><dashed_name>technology</dashed_name><name>Technology</name></category><has_images>False</has_images><description>Twitter   unleashed a major redesign  of its platform on Thursday, including brand new versions of its Android and iPhone apps.

 Israeli entrepreneur Rotem Guez says he has legally changed his name to that of Facebook's CEO, a gimmick meant to persuade the social networking site to back down from what he says are threats to take legal action against him.

But they are driving a car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;The agency based its recommendation on evidence from its investigation of numerous crashes in which electronic distraction was a major contributing factor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; Non-binding &lt;p&gt;No states are bound to adopt the recommendation and initial indications appear to suggest that none of them actually will and that any changes would require a huge shift in mentality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reports that lawmakers are unlikely to risk upsetting voters who're used to using their smartphones while on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any ban would also impact car manufacturers who're placing stock in in-car wireless integration systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it stands nine states have banned hand held phone, while 35 have made texting illegal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's going to be very unpopular with some people,&quot; added Hersman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're not here to win a popularity contest.

&lt;p&gt;Jive sold 13.4 million shares, up from plans to sell 11,700,470 shares priced between $8 and $10 per share. The total offering is $160.8 million, with a market capitalization of about $700 million. Jive is the first of an expected 11 IPOs this week, which include Zynga later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the popularity of social networks such as Facebook, businesses are now increasingly using consumer-friendly collaboration and communication tools built specifically for enterprises. Jive Software is riding this wave as these social tools become more and more common inside of companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large companies such as IBM and Microsoft as well as a  number of other startups such as Yammer are also going after this market. Interest in cloud computing more generally has racheted up in recent weeks with acquisitions such as SAPâs $3.4 billion deal for SuccessFactors, IBMâs $440 million deal for DemandTec, and Oracleâs $1.5 billion deal for RightNow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jive is backed by prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and has raised $97.7 million in total. Both firms, and their respective partners Jim Goetz of Sequoia and Ted Schlein of Kleiner, will make out well from the IPO. Sequoia holds 34.73%  of the company and will hold 29.9% after the IPO. Kleiner holds 13.64% and will hold 11.47% after the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jive was founded in 2001 in Iowa City by two computer science graduates, Matt Tucker and Bill Lynch, building online forum software for helping companies manage online communities. The company went through a number of changes, eventually moving into what was then a new area: enterprise social networking, providing tools for employees to collaborate and communicate.

 THE DIP: Zynga Inc. saw its stock dinged on its first day of trading Friday â an unexpected turn of events for a closely watched initial public offering seen as a precursor to Facebook's next year. The stock fell 50 cents, or 5 percent, to close at $9.50.
WHAT A SURPRISE: Eye-popping jumps have been the trend this year for freshly public Internet darlings such as LinkedIn Corp., which saw its stock double on its first trading day.

They're all precursors to Facebook's public debut expected sometime after April next year. Facebook could fetch as much as $10 billion in its offering.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Zynga, whose games are played mainly on Facebook, plans to sell its shares at $8.50 to $10 each. If the shares are priced at $10, Zynga will be valued at $7 billion based on the number of its total shares. That's a smaller valuation that the company's shares have traded recently on SharesPost, a secondary stock exchange used to trade the stock of privately held companies. There, a recent trade valued Zynga at $11.7 billion.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The company expects to sell 14.3 percent of its available stock, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That's a relatively high &quot;float,&quot; which could give investors confidence that the company isn't trying to artificially inflate its value. Groupon raised some concerns when it sold just 5.5 percent of its outstanding stock. Though not unprecedented, the amount was below that of many prominent tech companies, such as Google (7.2 percent), Amazon (12.6 percent) and LinkedIn (8.2 percent).&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The offering gives investors the option to buy an additional 15 million shares to cover over-allotments, bringing the total number of shares for sale to 115 million.</description><title>Zynga hopes to raise about $1 billion in IPO</title><topic_set><topic>Facebook</topic><topic>LinkedIn Corporation</topic><topic>Groupon</topic></topic_set><created_at>2011-12-02 22:39:05</created_at><source><website>http://www.thestate.com</website><name>The State</name><circulation>302360</circulation><country>US</country><frequency>Daily</frequency><media_type>Newspaper</media_type><guid>13fb932010f2f13a667cc731780c0039</guid><is_blog>0</is_blog><thumbnail>http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.thestate.com</thumbnail><description>The State is in the top 100 U.S. Newspapers by circulation.</description></source><published_at>2011-12-02 20:39:00</published_at><score>1.0033945</score><link>http://www.thestate.com/2011/12/02/2066398/zynga-plans-to-raise-up-to-115b.html#RSS=technology</link><guid>45e8529bb8f438b7f27c52857929b246</guid></article></article_set></cluster><cluster><article_set><article><category><dashed_name>technology</dashed_name><name>Technology</name></category><has_images>True</has_images><description>Zynga is poised to harvest some cold hard cash in its initial public offering.

The new version of Twitter, which the company is gradually making available starting on Thursday, will feature a new look and feel and faster performance, the company said.
The redesigned website comes as Twitter is taking steps to introduce more advertising on the site and as Twitter faces increased competition from Web giants Facebook and Google Inc .
&quot;We have to provide the simplest and fastest way for people around the world to connect to everything they care about,&quot; Twitter Chief Executive Dick Costolo said as he introduced the new version of the site at an event at the company's future headquarters in San Francisco.
Costolo appeared alongside Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who returned to the company in March as executive chairman to oversee the company's product design and development efforts.
Twitter allows people to send 140-character messages, or &quot;tweets,&quot; throughout the network of over 100 million users. It is one of the Web's most popular social networking services, along with Facebook and Zynga.
In October, Apple Inc integrated Twitter's service directly into the software that powers the popular iPhones. Since then, Dorsey said, the number of monthly sign-ups for Twitter have increased 25 percent.
Even as Twitter continues to grow, it faces fresh competition from Google, which introduced a social networking service with capabilities similar to Twitter earlier this year.
On Thursday, Facebook, the world's No.1 social networking service, announced a new feature that allows its users to visit a website and &quot;subscribe&quot; to updates from celebrities, journalists and other public figures.
The new version of Twitter seeks to simplify the service and to make it easier for new users to understand various Twitter-specific features, such as the # symbol that is used to search for topics on the service.
&quot;Twitter should be useful by those who know the shortcuts, and also equally useful by those who don't really use the shortcuts,&quot; said Dorsey.
A new &quot;Discover&quot; section of the website highlights the most popular topics on the site based on each user's location and interests.
The new version of Twitter also features a revamped profile page, in which a company can customize the look of their brand and highlight specific content, such as videos or photos. Previously, the profile pages displayed a chronological list of the company's most recent Tweets.
Twitter said that 21 brands, including General Electric and Pepsi, have already revamped their profile pages to take advantage of the new capabilities. Twitter will gradually make the new profile page features available to all its users.
&quot;For marketers, this is something that they've been asking for of us for a while,&quot; Adam Bain, who leads Twitter's revenue efforts, said in an interview after the briefing.
Twitter is taking steps to build a profitable business on top of its popular service. The company began showing ads on limited parts of the service in 2010 and is expected to generate about $140 million in ad revenue this year, according to estimates by industry research firm eMarketer.
The company said it has more than 2,400 advertisers and it expects to launch an advertising system early next year that will allow companies to quickly create marketing campaigns on Twitter.
Twitter hosted Thursday's event at its future headquarters in San Francisco, which are currently under construction and which Twitter plans to move into this summer. The building will accommodate far more than the company's current staff of 700 employees, Costolo said.
&quot;It holds thousands of people,&quot; he said of the office. &quot;We're going to need all this space to scale the company to support the growth of the product we've been experiencing over the last year.&quot;
(This version corrects last paragraph to show number of Twitter advertisers total more than 2,400 not 3,400)

&lt;p&gt;The New York City store, reputed to be Appleâs largest so far, joins other prime locations in Paris, Milan, and Tokyo, as well as fellow metropolitan-area stores in upscale neighborhoods like 5th Avenue and the Upper West Side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new store will cost Apple $800,000 a month in rent, a testament to profits the company likely expects to generate from the new location, and occupies the balcony overlooking the entrance to tracks 100-117, where many west-bound trains depart the city for upscale suburban destinations in Westchester County, New York and in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appleâs four other NYC locations serve greater Manhattan, so the new store is likely meant to appeal to the 750,000 travelers and tourists that pass through the transportation hub each day. The Wall Street Journal reports more than half of those travelers have a yearly household income exceeding $100,000, a good target demographic for Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and Android are locked in a fierce competition for dominance of the smartphone and tablet markets, but Apple is the fastest-growing retailer in the U.S., representing 20 percent of total U.S. retail sales growth. The company has made its retail presence one of the cornerstones of its business model, and smart placement continues to be part of its strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, many travelers in Grand Central Station at least occasionally experience long wait times when trains are delayed, so browsing the nearby Apple store may be a fun option for bored commuters. The store also aims to accommodate business travelers, with on-peak operating hours from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commuters especially know the true value of portable entertainment that can drown out fellow passengers and make a lengthy train ride somewhat enjoyable, so spur-of-the-moment purchases may also boost the storeâs revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appleâs latest store places its iconic brand in an iconic location, and the combination may prove to be an irresistible draw for weary travelers and tourists from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;An idea being considered is putting Facebookâs Sponsored Stories ads, which feature friendsâ interactions with brands, within the mobile News Feed, said the people, who declined to be identified because the plans arenât public. The News Feed lets users view status updates, photos and other content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Facebook, the worldâs most popular social-networking service, would be playing catch-up in mobile advertising to Google Inc., Apple Inc. and Millennial Media Inc. Facebookâs potential advantage is that by gathering so much information about a personâs interests and associates, it can help advertisers target potential customers more directly than mobile Web browsers or applications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Facebook, which boasts more than 800 million users, is increasing its focus on mobile technology, aiming to take advantage of the shift to smartphones and tablets. The company expects its next 1 billion users to come mainly from mobile devices, rather than desktop computers. More than 350 million users already access Facebook through their mobile devices, according to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Later Than Expected?&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The company had originally expected to roll out the new advertising service on mobile devices earlier this year, and the plan could be delayed again, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Brandon McCormick, a spokesman for Facebook, declined to comment. Facebook announced a mobile deals service last year that lets companies reach out to potential customers with discounts based on location.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The Palo Alto, California-based company is considering raising about $10 billion in an IPO that would value the company at more than $100 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company may file for the IPO before the end of the year, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Facebookâs revenue will climb to as high as $6.9 billion in 2012, up from $4.27 billion this year, according to research firm New York-based EMarketer Inc. Almost 90 percent of 2011 sales will come from advertising revenue, the firm estimates. Facebook also makes money from its Credits business, which takes a commission on transactions in certain applications, such as games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that markets are generally rallying.  Italy is up 1% , so there's that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is that short-term yields are improving again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on  2-year Italian  and  2-year Spanish bonds  are both dropping nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that  yields on Italian 10-year debt , which desperately needs to come down, is jumping higher again. Until we start seeing improvement there, it's hard to start building a bull case.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The developer of games such as âCityVille,â âFarmVilleâ and âMafia Warsâ sold 100 million shares for $10 each, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Zynga had offered the stock for $8.50 to $10 apiece. It will start trading today on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol ZNGA.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The offering is the biggest by a U.S. Internet company since Google Inc. raised $1.9 billion in its 2004 IPO, Bloomberg data show. The game makerâs increasing ubiquity and expansion prospects appeal to investors, according to Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;âZynga and its games are becoming consumer brands and there is a lot of recognition for growth potential,â he said. âMy guess is that the shares will be well-received.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Founded by Chief Executive Officer Mark Pincus in 2007, Zynga doubled sales to $829 million in the first nine months of 2011. The IPO values Zynga at as much as $7 billion, or 6.8 times revenue in the year through Sept. 30. Thatâs more than three times rival Electronic Arts Inc.âs price relative to sales over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Electronic Arts, based in Redwood City, California, bolstered its own online services by purchasing PopCap Games this year. EA, the maker of âThe Simsâ and âScrabbleâ for mobile devices had a market value of $6.9 billion, or about 1.8 times trailing 12-month sales.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;âMore Competitionâ&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Nexon Co., a Tokyo-based maker of games for Facebook including âZombie Misfits,â started trading this week after raising $1.2 billion in an IPO, Japanâs biggest this year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;âYouâre definitely going to see more competitionâ for Zynga as other companies expand their user bases, said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York. âOn the other hand, I think itâs also going to bring more people into the overall social gaming space.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga planned to offer about 14 percent of its common stock, according to a regulatory filing. That compares with less than 10 percent for companies including Groupon Inc., LinkedIn Corp., and Pandora Media Inc., which made their public debuts this year. Internet companies have used smaller free floats to boost initial demand for their stock, pushing the price higher.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Avalon Ventures, Google&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga planned to sell all of the shares in the IPO, and to use net proceeds of about $889 million for game development, marketing and general corporate purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Backers including Avalon Ventures, Foundry Group and Google may trim their stakes if underwriters exercise an over-allotment to buy 15 million additional shares, according to the original terms of the offering. Venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Zyngaâs biggest shareholder after Pincus, didnât plan to sell shares in the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The market value Zynga sought in its IPO was less than a $14.1 billion fair-value estimate of the companyâs worth as of August, according to the prospectus. The company settled on a price range after taking into account recent IPOs that underperformed, according to a Dec. 10 filing. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led Zyngaâs offering.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Social Media&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Groupon, the Chicago-based provider of online coupons, raised $805 million in its IPO last month, including the over- allotment option. The shares, which surged as much as 31 percent in the first weeks of trading, have since fallen 12 percent from their high.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Angieâs List Inc., the Indianapolis-based operator of a consumer-reviews website, raised $132 million in its IPO last month, including an over-allotment. The stock surged in its first day of trading before falling as much as 11 percent below its offer price.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Both Groupon and Angieâs List are trading above their offer prices. Sixty percent of the Internet or social-media companies that completed U.S. IPOs since 2010 are trading below offer price, Kevin Pleines, an analyst at Birinyi Associates Inc. in Westport, Connecticut, said in a Dec. 13 research note. Buyers of the shares at their opening trade in the public market have lost an average of 32 percent, Pleines said.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga gets more than 90 percent of its revenue from Palo Alto, California-based Facebook, operator of the worldâs largest social network. Facebook is examining a $10 billion IPO that would value the company at more than $100 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month.&lt;/p&gt;

information and trading products. These include market data, such as share prices and currency rates, research and analytics, as well as trading systems that
allow dealers to buy and sell such things as currencies and shares on a computer screen instead of by telephone or on a trading floor like that of the New York

					Complete overhaul announced 
					 				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					
					   
					&lt;p&gt;It's all systems go over at Spotify Towers. 2011 has seen the company get friendly with Facebook, the long awaited US launch and also the  revelation of Spotify apps . But the music streaming platform isn't ready to stop with the roll-outs just yet it seems, as it has just announced the all-new Spotify Radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revamped service allows for unlimited stations based on your choice of track, artist or genre; unlimited skips so you can swerve anything it throws up that you don't fancy and an &quot;all new intelligent recommendation engine&quot; to make the radio's choices more relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Parks, Spotifyâs chief content officer, said: &quot;Spotify Radio is an amazing new?radio experience, offering unlimited stations and unlimited skips. With our new intelligent recommendation engine?and multi-million track library, the new Spotify Radio is a music discovery experience without equal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's available to both free loaders and Spotify Premium users and it will enter the mainstream in the next few days, alongside the new Spotify apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't wait you can  grab a preview now .&lt;/p&gt;

A new study from SocialStrategy1 and OfficeArrow indicates that more than two-thirds of business owners will not invest in social media in 2012. The study, outlined in an infographic at Mediabistro.com, suggests that while an overwhelming majority of small business owners understand how social media can have a direct effect on their bottom-line, less than a third of them plan to actually invest in it. The study analyzed 343 executives from companies of less than 10 employees each. So how are small businesses using social media? 61% have tried Facebook 48% have tried LinkedIn 37% have tried Twitter 14% have tried Google Plus And why are small businesses using social media? 48% want to increase brand awareness 33% want to generate more leads 32% want to improve customer service 17% want to enhance ratings and reviews 31% donât know where to start And who do small businesses assign to manage their social media? 18% manage it themselves 15% outsource to a specialized service 13% donât even use social media 8% assign it to the marketing department 4% assign it to a director 3% assign it to the IT department And the most surprising statistic of all: only 30 percent of small businesses plan to invest in social media next year. One reason for the lack in social media interest might be the fact that only 4 percent of those polled actually used social monitoring programs, suggesting that 96 percent donât have an accurate understanding of how their current social strategies are performing.Â  Another reason might be that many small businesses reported being overwhelmed with information overload, having too many different social networking websites to manage with not enough employees to realize its true potential. Does your company plan to invest in social media next year?Â  If so, how?</description><title>STUDY: How small businesses are [not] using social media</title><topic_set><topic>Twitter Inc</topic><topic>Social Media</topic><topic>LinkedIn Corporation</topic><topic>Facebook</topic></topic_set><created_at>2011-12-09 18:03:31</created_at><author_set><author>agreenhaw, </author></author_set><source><website>http://www.paysimple.com/blog</website><name>Small Business Merchant Account and ACH Processing: The PaySimple Blog</name><circulation>28477</circulation><country>US</country><frequency>Daily</frequency><media_type>Blog</media_type><guid>8e346f1a2317dac99c6db7bcbe5eddb4</guid><is_blog>0</is_blog><thumbnail>http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.paysimple.com/blog</thumbnail><description>Small Business Merchant Account and ACH Processing: The PaySimple Blog</description></source><published_at>2011-12-09 17:04:53</published_at><score>1.0038084</score><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ThePaySimpleBlog/~3/URE2ivuix5g/</link><guid>3228fc892c926613b6165ca83ac72b48</guid><metadata><social_metrics><twitter__i>3</twitter__i></social_metrics></metadata></article></article_set></cluster><cluster><article_set><article><category><dashed_name>business</dashed_name><name>Business</name></category><has_images>False</has_images><description>Thank you for being our friend. âFacebook Friend of the Day 12.15.11â³ is categorized as âlocalâ.

        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Dec. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Zynga Inc., the largest maker of games for Facebook, declined in its first day of trading after raising $1 billion in an initial public offering that gave it a greater valuation than rival Electronic Arts Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The shares, listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol ZNGA, fell 5 percent to $9.50. The developer of games such as âCityVille,â âFarmVilleâ and âMafia Warsâ sold 100 million shares for $10 each, the top end of a proposed range.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga gets more than 90 percent of its revenue from Palo Alto, California-based Facebook Inc., and faces increasing competition from Electronic Arts, which bolstered its own online services by purchasing PopCap Games this year. Nexon Co., a Tokyo-based maker of games for Facebook including âZombie Misfits,â slumped 15 percent this week after raising $1.2 billion in an IPO, Japanâs biggest this year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;âZynga was offered at a pretty aggressive price relative to other game makers in the marketplace,â said Jack Ablin, who helps oversee $55 billion as chief investment officer for Chicago-based Harris Private Bank. âAnyone that has any affiliation with social media is getting bought up by an investing public that wants to be involved. And then reality hits.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The offering is the biggest by a U.S. Internet company since Google Inc. raised $1.9 billion in its 2004 IPO, data compiled by Bloomberg show.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;âGrowth Potentialâ&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zyngaâs increasing ubiquity and expansion prospects appeal to investors, according to Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;âZynga and its games are becoming consumer brands, and there is a lot of recognition for growth potential,â he said.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Founded by Chief Executive Officer Mark Pincus in 2007, Zynga doubled sales to $829 million in the first nine months of 2011. The IPO valued Zynga at as much as $7 billion, or 6.8 times revenue in the year through Sept. 30. Thatâs more than three times rival Electronic Artsâ price relative to sales over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;âWeâre bigger believers in the future of play and social gaming than any other company and we wanted to be in a position that we had the resources to invest more in that future than any other company,â Pincus said in an interview today.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Electronic Arts, the Redwood City, California-based maker of âThe Simsâ and âScrabbleâ for mobile devices, had a market value of $6.9 billion as of yesterdayâs close, or about 1.8 times trailing 12-month sales.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Bigger Float&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga planned to offer about 14 percent of its common stock, according to a regulatory filing. That compares with less than 10 percent for companies including Groupon Inc., LinkedIn Corp., and Pandora Media Inc., which made their public debuts this year. Internet companies have used smaller free floats to boost initial demand for their stock, pushing the price higher.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga sold all of the shares in the IPO, and plans to use net proceeds for game development, marketing and general corporate purposes, according to its filing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Underwriters have an option to buy an additional 15 million shares to cover over-allotments, Zynga said in its statement. That may allow backers including Avalon Ventures, Foundry Group and Google to trim their stakes, according to the original terms of the offering. Venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Zyngaâs biggest shareholder after Pincus, didnât plan to sell shares in the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Groupon, Angieâs List&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The market value Zynga sought in its IPO was less than a $14.1 billion fair-value estimate of the companyâs worth as of August, according to the prospectus. The company settled on a price range after taking into account recent IPOs that underperformed, according to a Dec. 10 filing. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led Zyngaâs offering.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Groupon, the Chicago-based provider of online coupons, raised $805 million in its IPO last month, including the over- allotment option. The shares, which surged as much as 31 percent in the first weeks of trading, have since fallen 12 percent from their high, based on yesterdayâs close.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Angieâs List Inc., the Indianapolis-based operator of a consumer-reviews website, raised $132 million in its IPO last month, including an over-allotment. The stock surged in its first day of trading before falling as much as 11 percent below its offer price.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Both Groupon and Angieâs List are trading above their offer prices.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;âToo Richâ&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Facebook, operator of the worldâs largest social network, is examining a $10 billion IPO that would value the company at more than $100 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Sixty percent of the Internet or social-media companies that completed U.S. IPOs since 2010 are trading below offer price, Kevin Pleines, an analyst at Birinyi Associates Inc. in Westport, Connecticut, said in a Dec. 13 research note. Buyers of the shares at their opening trade in the public market have lost an average of 32 percent, Pleines said.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga âshouldnât be valued at three times what other companies in that space are valued at,â said Jeffrey Sica, chief investment officer of Morristown, New Jersey-based Sica Wealth Management LLC, which oversees $1 billion. âThatâs why people looked at it as having a potential downside. Investors found it too rich.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga was also held back by âoverall concern in the market,â said Sica, who nevertheless advised clients to buy the Zynga IPO. âAn IPO investor canât be oblivious of the environment the IPO is coming out in.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (MainStreet) -- Your Facebook page is about to get a complete facelift.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook revealed Thursday that its long-awaited profile redesign known as Timeline is available for all users to try out. Anyone with an account has the option to sign up for the new profile by going to Facebook.com/timeline and clicking the &quot;Get Timeline&quot; button at the bottom of the page. Otherwise, they can wait for a notification to pop up at the top of their profile in the coming days alerting them to the change.

        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The developer of games such as âCityVille,â âFarmVilleâ and âMafia Warsâ sold 100 million shares for $10 each, according to the person, who declined to be identified because the details havenât been released. Zynga had offered the stock for $8.50 to $10 apiece. It will start trading tomorrow on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol ZNGA.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The offering is the biggest by a U.S. Internet company since Google Inc. raised $1.9 billion in its 2004 IPO, Bloomberg data show. The game makerâs surging sales appeal to investors seeking growth that outpaces members of the Standard &amp; Poorâs 500 Index, according to Tim Cunningham, a money manager at Thornburg Investment Management Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;âGrowth is really scarce, so I think that makes it more valuable than usual,â said Cunningham, who helps oversee about $74 billion at Thornburg in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Founded by Chief Executive Officer Mark Pincus in 2007, Zynga doubled sales to $829 million in the first nine months of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The IPO values Zynga at as much as $7 billion, or 6.8 times revenue in the year through Sept. 30. Thatâs more than three times rival Electronic Arts Inc.âs price relative to sales over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Electronic Arts, based in Redwood City, California, bolstered its own online services by purchasing PopCap Games this year. EA, the maker of âThe Simsâ and âScrabbleâ for mobile devices had a market value of $6.9 billion, or about 1.8 times trailing 12-month sales.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;âMore Competitionâ&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Nexon Co., a Tokyo-based maker of games for Facebook including âZombie Misfits,â fell on each of its first two days of trading this week after holding a $1.2 billion IPO, Japanâs biggest this year. The stock is down 4.3 percent since the offering.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;âYouâre definitely going to see more competitionâ for Zynga as other companies expand their user bases, said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York. âOn the other hand, I think itâs also going to bring more people into the overall social gaming space.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga planned to offer about 14 percent of its common stock, according to a regulatory filing. That compares with less than 10 percent for companies including Groupon Inc., LinkedIn Corp., and Pandora Media Inc., which made their public debuts this year. Internet companies have used smaller free floats to boost initial demand for their stock, pushing the price higher.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Avalon Ventures, Google&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga planned to sell all of the shares in the IPO, and to use net proceeds of about $889 million for game development, marketing and general corporate purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Backers including Avalon Ventures, Foundry Group and Google may trim their stakes if underwriters exercise an over-allotment to buy 15 million additional shares, according to the original terms of the offering. Venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Zyngaâs biggest shareholder after Pincus, didnât plan to sell shares in the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The market value Zynga sought in its IPO was less than a $14.1 billion fair-value estimate of the companyâs worth as of August, according to the prospectus. The company settled on a price range after taking into account recent IPOs that underperformed, according to a Dec. 10 filing. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led Zyngaâs offering.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Social Media&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Groupon, the Chicago-based provider of online coupons, raised $805 million in its IPO last month, including the over- allotment option. The shares, which surged as much as 31 percent in the first weeks of trading, have since fallen 12 percent from their high.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Angieâs List Inc., the Indianapolis-based operator of a consumer-reviews website, raised $132 million in its IPO last month, including an over-allotment. The stock surged in its first day of trading before falling as much as 11 percent below its offer price.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Both Groupon and Angieâs List are trading above their offer prices. Sixty percent of the Internet or social-media companies that completed U.S. IPOs since 2010 are trading below offer price, Kevin Pleines, an analyst at Birinyi Associates Inc. in Westport, Connecticut, said in a Dec. 13 research note. Buyers of the shares at their opening trade in the public market have lost an average of 32 percent, Pleines said.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga gets more than 90 percent of its revenue from Palo Alto, California-based Facebook, operator of the worldâs largest social network. Facebook is examining a $10 billion IPO that would value the company at more than $100 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month.&lt;/p&gt;

Would Tom Meltzer get similarly hooked?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alec Baldwin, star of 30 Rock,  tweeted  yesterday that he was &quot;reamed out&quot; by a flight attendant for playing the online anagram game  Words With Friends  while the plane he was on idled at a gate. A spokesman for the actor  told reporters that Baldwin loved the game &quot;so much&quot; he had left the plane and caught a later flight instead â just so he could keep on playing .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by Baldwin's addiction, I signed up for the game on Facebook, and set myself a time limit: I would play for an hour and a half, and then, if I could, I would quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, Words With Friends is impossible to describe without using the word Scrabble. Values have been changed, the board redesigned and the whole thing repackaged for the digital age, but in essence the game is the same: make high-scoring words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its great innovation is what poker players call multi-tabling: the ability to play several games at once. I start up a game with a random online opponent, make a move, get bored waiting for a response, and start up another. Soon I have got seven games on the go and there is no spare time at all. I feel like a chess grandmaster playing a whole room at once. And losing â a lot â to players using suspiciously  odd words such as &quot;toit&quot;, &quot;moke&quot; and &quot; peens &quot; (meaning &quot;manipulates with the back of a hammer&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the time comes to quit, it's a struggle, but I do it. Then again, I wasn't playing, as the title suggests, with friends. I suspect if I did it would be very difficult indeed to &quot;peen&quot; myself away.&lt;/p&gt;    Alec Baldwin    Apps    Mobile phones    United States      Tom Meltzer     guardian.co.uk  Â© 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The managing editor of NBCLatino.com, Chris Pena, says the site will launch in early 2012 but did not give a specific date. For now,  &gt;readers can check out the site's Tumblr blog .  Mr. Pena says the new site will leverage NBC Universal's resources, including those of its Spanish-language network Telemundo. It will focus on the U.S. Hispanic community.  Telemundo's rival, Spanish-language giant Univision already has a similar English-language news site and Facebook page. Last year, Fox News unveiled its online Fox News Latino. And The Huffington Post recently launched Huffpost LatinoVoices.  The new sites have sprung up as the latest census numbers show U.S. born natives have surpassed immigrants as the fastest growing Hispanic community.</description><title>NBC to launch Latino news site</title><topic_set><topic>Spanish language</topic><topic>Huffington Post</topic><topic>Language &amp; Linguistics</topic><topic>English Language</topic><topic>Facebook</topic></topic_set><created_at>2011-12-16 16:06:00</created_at><source><website>http://www.newyorkbusiness.com</website><name>NewYorkBusiness.com</name><circulation>1961</circulation><country>US</country><frequency>Daily</frequency><media_type>Mainstream</media_type><guid>4449eacd6ba8c84fb4bd0984b2e4810b</guid><is_blog>0</is_blog><thumbnail>http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.newyorkbusiness.com</thumbnail><description>NewYorkBusiness.com</description></source><published_at>2011-12-16 14:16:15</published_at><score>1.004707</score><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/crainsnewyork/latestnews/~3/2JFHQsle7dY/1072</link><guid>785141403d6666f13981dbea1d473253</guid></article></article_set></cluster><cluster><article_set><article><category><dashed_name>business</dashed_name><name>Business</name></category><has_images>False</has_images><description>Gowalla has a new destination: Facebook.

        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Dec. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Zynga Inc. is seeking to raise as much as $1 billion in the biggest initial public offering by a U.S. Internet company since Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The company is offering 100 million shares for $8.50 to $10 apiece, according to a regulatory filing today. The high end of the range would value San Francisco-based Zynga, the biggest developer of games for Facebook Inc., at $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga had originally planned a larger IPO, scaling back after Internet companies including Groupon Inc. and Pandora Media Inc. sank following their debuts this year, a person familiar with the plans said yesterday. Zynga is selling about 14 percent of its common stock, a larger portion than some Web companies have sold this year in offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;âItâs a reflection of what weâve seen in Groupon,â said David Dillon, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which oversees about $17 billion. âIf you price yourself too high, you do yourself a disservice in the long term.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The top end of Zyngaâs price range would value the company at 6.8 times trailing 12-month sales, according to the filing. Game maker Electronic Arts Inc. had a market value of $7.73 billion at yesterdayâs close, or about 2 times sales in the same period, Bloomberg data show.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Facebook IPO?&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Facebook may raise about $10 billion in an IPO next year that would value the worldâs largest social-networking site at more than $100 billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said Nov. 29. Google, operator of the worldâs biggest search engine, raised $1.9 billion in its 2004 IPO, including an over- allotment option.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga is selling all of the 100 million shares in the offering. If underwriters exercise an option to buy 15 million additional shares in the over-allotment, then venture backer Avalon Ventures would sell the largest portion at more than 2.5 million. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Pincus, who isnât selling any shares in the offering, will have about 37 percent voting control once the offering is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;If the over-allotment is exercised, Foundry Group and Institutional Venture Partners would each sell about 2.5 million shares, while Union Square Ventures would offer 2.2 million. Venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Zyngaâs biggest shareholder after Pincus, isnât selling shares in the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Google and buyout firm Silver Lake would trim their stakes by about 1.7 million shares each. Mail.ru Group Ltd. and Digital Sky Technologies, both managed by Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, would sell more than 1 million shares combined. Investment firm Tiger Global Management would offer about 554,000 shares.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Popular Games&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Zynga aims to capitalize on the popularity of social networks and virtual goods. The company lets users play games for free and then makes money by selling items, such as a townhouse in âCityVilleâ or a shipyard in âEmpires &amp; Allies.â&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Founded in 2007, Zynga has hired Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to manage the IPO. Zyngaâs shares will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol ZNGA.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;About 6.7 million of Zynga users were paying customers in the first nine months of the year, up from 5.1 million in the year-earlier period, according to the filing. Revenue more than doubled to $828.9 million. The worldwide virtual-goods market will more than double to $22.5 billion in 2015 from $9.27 billion last year, according to Lazard Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In October, Zynga announced a new service, called Project Z, geared toward reducing its dependence on Facebook users. The company also introduced new games, including âZynga Bingoâ and âHidden Chronicles.â&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Diversifying&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Ninety-three percent of Zyngaâs third-quarter revenue was generated on Facebook, the worldâs most popular social network. That number has ranged from 91 percent to 94 percent since the beginning of last year, according to Zynga filings.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Adding more mobile games is part of Zyngaâs plan to diversify. The company said in November that the number of daily active users on mobile devices increased more than 10-fold from November 2010 to September 2011, reaching 9.9 million. By October, the number was 11.1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Sunil Paul, a founding partner of venture capital firm Spring Ventures, recently joined Zyngaâs board. Paul, who started software companies Brightmail Inc. and FreeLoader, was brought on because of âhis extensive experience with Internet companies,â Zynga said on Nov. 17.&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Grouponâs Offering&lt;/p&gt;
         
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Groupon went public earlier this month, helping revive the IPO market after the European debt crisis and stock-market volatility hampered deals. The shares of the Chicago-based company, which leads the Internet-coupon industry, have dropped 5.3 percent through yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Angieâs List, a site that rates plumbers, contractors and other service providers, has seen its shares decline 3.5 percent since their debut on the Nasdaq on Nov. 17.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Yelp Inc., which features user reviews of restaurants and businesses, also is planning an IPO. The San Francisco-based company filed on Nov. 17 to raise as much as $100 million in a 2012 offering. The $100 million amount is typically used as a placeholder to calculate fees and may change.&lt;/p&gt;

Kidd anchors nightly news casts for the Belo Corp.-owned Phoenix station. She has been with Channel 3 for 10 years. Her last day will be Dec. 30.

Channel 3 announced her departure Friday.

Kidd said via Facebook and Twitter that she will be staying in Arizona. That will start speculation about Kidd landing at another Phoenix station. Channel 3 morning personality Tara Hitchcock left the same station earlier this year.

Veteran sportscaster Brad Cesmat also left KTVK earlier this year.</description><title>Beverly Kidd leaving KTVK-TV Channel 3 in Phoenix</title><topic_set><topic>Phoenix (Arizona)</topic><topic>Facebook</topic></topic_set><created_at>2011-12-17 22:39:18</created_at><author_set><author>Sunnucks, Mike</author></author_set><source><website>http://dayton.bizjournals.com/dayton</website><name>Dayton Business Journal</name><circulation>3202974</circulation><country>US</country><frequency>Daily</frequency><media_type>Mainstream</media_type><guid>9209caba6e5ef65a09f7767e783f8a7e</guid><is_blog>0</is_blog><thumbnail>http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=dayton.bizjournals.com/dayton</thumbnail><description>Dayton Business Journal</description></source><published_at>2011-12-17 22:12:37</published_at><score>1.011896</score><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bizj_national/~3/nKl8NdN6S04/beverly-kidd-leaving-ktvk-tv-channel-3.html</link><guid>db196d684b706ebd77862a5159f896b1</guid></article></article_set></cluster><cluster><article_set><article><category><dashed_name>business</dashed_name><name>Business</name></category><has_images>False</has_images><description>NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Online games developer Zynga Inc scored badly as it went public on Friday, dashing hopes for the year's hottest tech IPO, as investors frowned on its over-reliance on Facebook, dimming growth prospects, and outsized control by CEO Mark Pincus.</description><title>Zynga falters in debut, sheds doubt on IPO market</title><topic_set><topic>Zynga</topic><topic>Facebook</topic></topic_set><created_at>2011-12-17 00:28:35</created_at><source><website>http://www.reuters.com</website><name>Reuters</name><circulation>7081014</circulation><country>UK</country><company_type>Public</company_type><founded>1851</founded><frequency>Daily</frequency><owner>Reuters</owner><media_type>Newswire</media_type><guid>1d6a203ee1cf446922f9a96ffab56ae3</guid><is_blog>0</is_blog><thumbnail>http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.reuters.com</thumbnail><description>Reuters Group plc (LSE: RTR and NASDAQ: RTRSY) is a financial market data provider and news service that provides reports from around the world to newspapers

The provider of web-based software for managing sales, customer service and marketing said on Thursday that it has agreed to buy Rypple, a closely held company with 350 customers including social networking giant Facebook.
Salesforce said it expects the deal to close in the quarter ending April 30, 2012, and that it won't have a material impact on revenue in the coming fiscal year.
The company described the acquisition as the first step in an effort to build out a line of web-based human resources software for corporations.
Companies use Rypple to manage goal-setting, manager feedback, recognition and coaching using an interface that has the feel of modern social networking sites like Facebook.
Salesforce.com is internally developing additional human resources software to help companies in areas including recruitment, adding new workers and training them, said Executive Vice President John Wookey, who will run the new HR business unit.
Salesforce.com Chief Executive Marc Benioff credited Facebook for introducing him to Rypple, saying that the social networking site's chief information officer, Tim Campos, first told him about the three-year-old company.
Benioff told Reuters that human resources is the last major category of business management software he plans to introduce. &quot;This is enough,&quot; he said. &quot;We're in the major categories.&quot;
He said it would be several years before the human resources products account for a material share of revenue because his existing products are already relatively big sellers.
Analysts expected the company's revenue to climb 30 percent to $2.9 billion in the coming fiscal year, which ends in January 2013, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That's more than triple the comparable forecasts for SAP and Oracle.
The company is currently the biggest seller of web-based business management software, but is a far smaller company than either SAP or Oracle, which provide broad lines of software that is installed inside corporate data centers.
Oracle and SAP have invested heavily over the last few years to catch up with Salesforce in the business of selling web-based programs.
SAP announced earlier this month that it planned to spend $3.4 billion to buy SuccessFactors Inc, one of the biggest providers of web-based human-resources software.
Officials from SAP and Oracle declined comment on Salesforce.com's plans.

It was founded by Allen 'Al' Neuharth. The paper has the widest circulation of any
newspaper in the United States (averaging over 2.25 million copies every weekday),
and among English-language broadsheets, it comes second world-wide. USA Today is
distributed in all 50 states. USA Today was founded in 1982 with the goal of providing
a national newspaper in the U.S. market, where generally only a single local newspaper
was available. Colorful and bold, with many large diagrams, charts, and photographs,
it contrasted with the relatively colorless papers of the time such as The Wall Street
Journal and The New York Times. Emphasizing its national focus, USA Today became
well-known for its national polls on public sentiment.</description></source><published_at>2011-12-16 18:11:59</published_at><score>1.0172304</score><link>http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/usatoday-TechTopStories/~3/Rm8ez4-_F1Q/1</link><guid>2a8881d518e3ca24d4cd15e96471cdc8</guid></article></article_set></cluster><cluster><article_set><article><category><dashed_name>business</dashed_name><name>Business</name></category><has_images>False</has_images><description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your votes for person of the year and best retailer.&lt;/p&gt;  Continue reading... &lt;p&gt;Follow WWD on  Twitter  or become a fan on  Facebook .&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Readers' Choice: Best &amp; Worst of 2011</title><topic_set><topic>Facebook</topic></topic_set><created_at>2011-12-19 06:41:54</created_at><author_set><author>WWD.com, </author></author_set><source><website>http://wwd.com</website><name>Women's Wear Daily</name><circulation>142758</circulation><country>US</country><company_type>Private</company_type><founded>0</founded><frequency>daily</frequency><media_type>Blog</media_type><guid>dd7541691678e5baae32784ca76be302</guid><is_blog>1</is_blog><thumbnail>http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=wwd.com</thumbnail><description>Often called &quot;the fashion bible,&quot; Womens' Wear Daily serves as the voice of authority, international newswire and agent of change for the fashion, beauty and retail industries.

&lt;p&gt; UPDATE: Carrier IQ has responded to this report with  a statement of their own  â one that is quite explicit and actually makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrier IQ monitors activity on cell phones (allegedly down to the keystroke, according to  some reports ) and serves that data to mobile carriers and manufacturers. These companies say they use those reports to fix apps, improve service and better understand battery life issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Carrier IQ is also turning over the same data, including information about text messages, mobile web browsing and more, to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you get your torches and pitchforks, remember that just about every web company has a âspy guideâ â that is, a manual of procedures that dictate when and how law enforcement can get information about users. And by and large, companies comply with those requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Google recently issued a whole transparency report about  global government requests for user data . In the U.S. alone, Google received a total of 5,950 government and police requests about 11,057 unique accounts during the first half of 2011. The company fully or partially complied with 93 percent of those requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on facts such as these, whether or not you take umbrage with Carrier IQâs cooperating with the FBI should depend on your attitude toward government investigation and surveillance, not just your opinion of Carrier IQ, itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrier IQâs working with the FBI came to light due to a recent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) filing from  MuckRock .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the FBI didnât say exactly what kinds of information it gets from Carrier IQ, it revealed that such information is âlocated in an investigative file which is exempt from disclosureâ and that âthe records responsive to your request are law enforcement recordsâ involved in a pending proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weâve contacted Carrier IQ to determine if these are run-of-the-mill data requests from law enforcement and will update you if and when we hear back from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you wish not to be monitored by corporations and the government, we politely remind you to stay off the Internet, stop using all proprietary software and hardware, disconnect your cell phone and land line immediately, and ensure a snug fit on your tin foil helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

					Our pick of the bunch 
					 				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					
					   
					&lt;p&gt;Cast your mind back to the first camera phone you had - rubbish, wasn't it? Thankfully technology has moved on since then, and the cameras on our phones are actually decent enough to take usable snaps with. And with the increasing number of people now uploading photos directly from their phone to the likes of Facebook and Twitter, this is no longer early adopter technology. In fact, it's decidedly old news and we're now all looking for ways to make our snaps look a little bit different, without having to spend hours or even a single minute on Photoshop.  If you want to give your photos a retro vibe, or you'd like to take panoramic images or action sequences then, in the infuriatingly catchy words of Steve Jobs' marketing men, there's an app for that. Here are our favourites...&lt;/p&gt;
 ShakeIt 
&lt;p&gt;Ah, the Polaroid. The snapper of choice for amateur pornographers and kidnappers in films. Thanks to its lack of negatives and instant printing, the Polaroid has had something of a comeback for the hipster generation's love of all things retro.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you follow Outkast's suggestion and &quot;shake it like a Polaroid picture&quot;, the image will gradually appear on the screen, just like one of the real prints. That said, Polaroid has actually given up using wet ink for most of its cameras, so it's a bit of a waste of time. If it makes you feel good though, don't let us stop you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes :  Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price : ?0.69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating : 4/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
 Colour Splash 
&lt;p&gt;If you can't decide between taking conventional colour snaps and changing your images to moody monochrome, then this app kills two birds with one stone. Once you've taken a picture (or brought one in from your camera roll), the app automatically removes all of the colour, leaving you with a black and white photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then put the colour back into selected parts of the shot by simply touching the screen in the appropriate place. So simple, but the effect will make you look like you're some sort of arty pro.  Read More. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes  : Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price : ?0.69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating : 4/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
 Panorama 
&lt;p&gt;There are a few cameras around nowadays that will let you take Panoramic pics, such as the analogue  Lomography Spinner 360  and Sony cameras that sport the Sweep Panorama function. However, in days of old, you could get the same effect (or something close to it) by taking a series of pictures next to one another and then joining them together to make one long image.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's basically what this app does, although as the technical wizardry does the joining for you, you won't have to battle through a pile of photo prints with your scissors and glue stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes :  Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price : ?7.99&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating : 4/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
 Absolute Vintage? 
&lt;p&gt;Remember those vintage-style photo studios at theme parks where you can dress up in Victorian clothes and get a sepia-tinged photo taken? Well, that's the sort of thing this app does, but without having to get dressed up with a fake moustache.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You simply pick a vintage &quot;mask&quot; then add your photo to it and then you can add accessories such as beards and cigarettes, add a distressed border and change the colour to sepia or black and white. It might take some practice, but if you're willing to persevere then you can get some excellent results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes :  Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Price : ?0.69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating : 4/5  &lt;/p&gt;
 RetroCamera 
&lt;p&gt;If you're a big fan of retro photography, then this one's for you. RetroCamera lets you take snaps (or use existing pictures) and then apply a wide selection of effects to make it look like they've been taken on an analogue snapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can convert them into varying versions of black and white and sepia or use some more colourful effects. You can also add film sprockets or change the image to make it look like a negative, or you can add vignettes or film grain to add a little character. With so many options at your fingertips, this one's worth the very reasonable ?1.49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes :  Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price : ?1.49&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating : 4/5  &lt;/p&gt;
 LEGO Photo 
&lt;p&gt;If you're after something a little bit different, then this one from the iconic Danish toy firm is right up your street. If you've ever wondered what your mates might look like if they were made of LEGO (no?) then this fun little app can help you out.?&lt;/p&gt;
   
&lt;p&gt;You simply take a picture, tap the magic button and then your image is rendered with LEGO blocks. Each time you tap the screen after that it will change to a different selection of colours so that you can pick the best one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes :  Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price : Free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating : 4/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
 Photoburst? 
&lt;p&gt;This one's for all the action snappers and sports junkies out there. The app enables you to take up to 10 pictures per second which means that you can either pick the best shot, or use all of them as an action-packed storyboard.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even adjust the timings between shots in milliseconds to give you the exact amount of shots that you want. Of course, it's not limited to sports, you can take anything - as long as it's moving, otherwise it's rather pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes :  Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price : ?0.69&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating : 4/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
 Ghost Camera Pro 
&lt;p&gt;This novelty app is sure to be a hit with the pranksters and comes just in time for Halloween, too. You can either take a picture using the app, or import a pre-existing snap and then add a ghostly apparition to it to try and convince your pals that you've managed to capture a paranormal being on your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can move the ghoul around and change its size to make it look more realistic. A word of warning - this one's rated 9+, so keep it away from the nippers, unless you want to give them nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes :  Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price : ?1.49&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating : 4/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Warhol: D.I.Y. POP? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This arty app enables you to create your very own digital silkscreen print, just like pop artist Andy Warhol's famous works?featuring stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and er, Chairman Mao.?Using a snap from your built-in camera, or an existing image from your library, you can make your own?Warhol-style creation by following the in-app instructions and cropping and painting the image accordingly. Along the way?you can view images and videos to get the inside track on Warhol and his techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Warhol himself who once quipped: &quot;In the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes&quot;. And thanks to this new app, you can go one better and get your own 15 days of fame simply by?entering your chosen digital print into  a competition  via Facebook or Twitter, as the winning images will be?displayed in The Andy Warhol museum in Pittsburgh (for 15 days each).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes:?  Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price : ?1.49&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating : 4/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
 Burst Mode 
&lt;p&gt;This app is a great little photography tool - especially for those wanting a cheap and easy way of improving in their chosen sport.?In use the app itself is very simple; on booting up Burst Mode you'll  get your iPhone's camera with a shoot button and settings button. The  former being self-explanatory, the Burst Mode setting gives you control  over a self-timer, giving you 3, 5 and 10 second delays; Burst Speed,  from 1-24fps; and Number of Frames, from 5 up to 400 - pretty much all  you could want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this delivers is an excellent way of analysing a brief moving  image whilst playing sport - say a table tennis stroke, or your cue  action whilst playing snooker. It's true that the 24fps the app gives  isn't quite the 30fps of the native iPhone 4 video capabilities, but the  fact that you can analyse this frame by frame and then easily play it  back means the action is packaged in the right way. Although,  clearly, some of the action becomes blurred it still offers up a useful  and cheap way of attempting to correct common mistakes that might  otherwise go uncorrected.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes:   Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price : ?1.49&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating : 4/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
 PhotoToaster 
&lt;p&gt;Like many other photo apps, PhotoToaster enables you to apply lots of different effects to your snaps, making them look like vintage photos if you choose. You can crop your photos using three different frame formats (square, vertical rectangle or horizontal rectangle).?A comprehensive range of presets (split into basic, deluxe and supreme) will let you change the appearance of your snaps.?There are plenty of options on offer including coloured filters, along with retro effects to make your pictures look like polaroids, lomo snaps or vintage sepia prints.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nifty bit is when the effects are applied, the result is live so that you can see what your snap will look like in less than a second. If you don't like it, you can either &quot;undo&quot; what you've just done or select a different effect.?When you're done you can either save the image to your picture gallery or send it via email or SMS or post it to facebook and tumblr. This is a great little app that offers plenty of flexibility.  Read More &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes:   Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price:  ?1.49&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating:  4/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
 Videolicious 
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this app is that you can turn your raw video footage from your iDevice into properly edited videos to share with your pals. And the best bit is that you can do it in just three easy steps. Firstly, you need to choose your video clips and/or photos from the library on your gadget. Secondly, you use your Apple gadget's camera to film yourself talking about the pictures or videos in your &quot;movie&quot;. Then, thirdly, you select a song from your music library to use as the soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you've done the easy stuff, the app takes care of the tricky bit by automatically editing together your original footage with your commentary to make a documentary-style video. You can then upload the finished article directly to Facebook or YouTube from the app.  Read More &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
 IncrediBooth 
&lt;p&gt;With this photo booth-related app from the makers of Hipstamatic, you'll be able to re-live those moments of having your picture taken in a foul-smelling, dreary box; with the resulting image (after the obligatory 5 minute wait) giving you a look akin to a serial killer. It's just as well that the image would only be your official passport photo for the next 10 years.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have everyone you want in frame, hit the button and you'll get four shots with four different retro effects, whereby you can share one or all of the photos through the usual channels. Time, date and location are also included and new packs of lens are available every now and again through in-app purchases.  Read More &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; iTunes:   Link &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Price:  69p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rating:  5/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
 8mm Vintage Camera 
&lt;p&gt;This app is similar in style to the very popular?Hipstamatic app, as it produces various tarnished effects to your otherwise decent iPhone video, giving the impression it was taken 80 years ago.?The difference here is that, as the 8mm moniker suggests, the app is film, sorry video, based and as such gives your smartphone movies a cool, vintage look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app will allow you to add Dust and scratches, retro colours, flickering, light leaks and frame jitters, all of which can be produced with a single tap or swipe. For your ?1.49 you'll get five &quot;lenses&quot; including Clear, Flickering Frame, Spotlight, Light Leak and Color Fringing; these can then be mixed with five different &quot;films&quot; - 1920, 70s, Sakura, XPro, Siena - to produce a variety of different effects. There's also a jitter button to replicate the frame displacement made by old 8mm projectors. Great for retro fans.  Read More &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
 Touch Retouch 
&lt;p&gt;Not only is Touch Retouch cheap, it's also extremely simple to use. Just load a picture into the software, paint on the section you want to remove, click &quot;Go&quot;, and it will magically disappear before your eyes. You can change the size of the brush so you can be more accurate with the area you paint over, and if you make a mistake, you can redo or use the eraser to refine the area you've selected.?There's also a lasso tool to mark around a zone, so you don't have to scribble all over it, and you can pinch and zoom a picture as you see fit, allowing for the most intricate of editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictures can be grabbed from the device's library (or from camera, if there is one) and there are a couple of in-built training videos that can be played when you start up the application.?As a cheap and simple photo manipulation tool, Touch Retouch presses all the right buttons, and is essential for any amateur photographer who doesn't have the time or inclination to spend hours on editing.

 iStockphoto 
&lt;p&gt;iStockphoto is the picture-laden offering from the Getty Images-owned micropayment website of the same name.?The service provides royalty free stock photography as well as illustrations, audio files and videos. It's member generated and if you sign up to the service you can sell your files as well as buying stuff too.?The iPhone app brings the images and audio to your handset and lets you find exactly what you're looking for, from wherever you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also view data about the file that you are interested in such as who uploaded the file and when and how many times it has been viewed or downloaded.?Obviously, the app syncs with your desktop account so you can view or edit files in your &quot;lightbox&quot;, email them to your contacts, and you can also view your account details and see how much money you've made (or spent - not so good).If you're not on iStockphoto yet, you can still search and browse images (with an iStockphoto watermark) so if you're interested in photography then give it a go.

 Hipstamatic 
&lt;p&gt;With a name like Hipstamatic, and by the looks of the website, you could be forgiven for thinking that this was some totally spurious, style-over-substance app but this stalwart iPhone app is all about retro pictures. It enables you to take shots with a variety of different effects, which will add plenty of fun to your snaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effects include vignettes, blurring, over saturation, discoloured images, and as the blurb reads &quot;Hipstaprints have a casual and seemingly accidental snapshot feel&quot; fans of Lomography might well get a kick out of it.  Read More &lt;/p&gt;

 Instagram 
&lt;p&gt;The king of photo apps, Instagram has become an unparalleled iPhone success, combining retro style photography with Tweetable images and its own unique social network. In essence, the app lets you shoot and quickly edit snaps of your day to day happenings, then share them with your followers. The real trick is the speed at which it works, making it hassle free just to share things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get a variety of retro effects to choose from, as well as borders and the odd retouch option. You can also shoot snaps from within the app or load in things you have already taken. Once on the Instagram stream then friends can like and comment on images. They can also be posted directly to Facebook or Twitter.?&lt;/p&gt;
